# melkibro

A simple app to listen emails on an inbox and send them as media on spacebro.  

## ❓Why ?

It is a helpful input to send media in the spacebro galaxy. Send an
email to the inbox and then process it by making connections between
spacebro apps.

For example, you can send a picture to the mailbox, connect it to
blurrybro to blur it, connect it to altruistify/print to print it.
